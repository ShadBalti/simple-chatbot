# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities in Simple Chatbot, please follow these steps to report them:

1. **Verify the vulnerability**: Before reporting, please ensure that the issue is a security vulnerability. Not all bugs are security vulnerabilities.

2. **Submit an issue**: If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please create a new issue on the GitHub repository. Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

3. **Keep it private**: When reporting security vulnerabilities, please **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues. Instead, please use the GitHub Security Advisory feature to report the vulnerability privately.

4. **Coordinate the response**: Once the vulnerability is reported, the maintainers will work to assess and address the issue. Please be patient during this process and refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved.
